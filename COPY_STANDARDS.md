# CWT Studio Copy Standards & Glossary
## Human-First Voice Framework

### Voice Rules
1. **Human first, never formulaic.** Write like a person, not an algorithm.
2. **No empty flourishes.** No "this isn't just X, it's Y." Burn that.
3. **Short, declarative sentences.** Sharp edges. Clear restraint.
4. **No buzzwords, no jargon padding.** If it reads like filler, delete it.
5. **Write like someone with a spine.** Direct, real, undeniable.
6. **Contradictions welcome.** Don't smooth over complexity.
7. **CTAs must be commands.** "Start Your Sprint," "Apply to Join." Never "Learn More."
8. **Every word must cost something.** Copy should feel meant, not optimized.

### Messaging Architecture
**What we do**: Backend revenue systems. Infrastructure over inspiration.
**What we fix**: Revenue leaks. Broken systems. Unreliable forecasts.
**What you get**: Predictable revenue. Clean data. Systems that compound.

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Voice Attributes
1. **Human** — Real voice. No corporate-speak.
2. **Sharp** — Short sentences. Sharp edges. No padding.
3. **Direct** — Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
4. **Honest** — Trade-offs exist. Complexity exists. Don't hide it.
5. **Confident** — Know what we do. Don't apologize for it.

### Tone Calibration
- **Real, not polished**: Edges over smoothness
- **Operator-first**: Built by people who do the work
- **No fluff**: If it doesn't add value, delete it
- **Spine over polish**: Would rather be too direct than too vague
